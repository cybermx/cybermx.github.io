I am a Full Professor and Director of the [Masters Program](https://math.illinoisstate.edu/graduate/masters-program/overview/) in the Department of Mathematics at Illinois State University. In addition to my academic role, I also serve as a Cyber Risk Advisor for CloudCover Inc and a Cyber Insurance Advisor for Rankiteo LTD. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work as an advisor and consultant for other companies in the industry, bringing my expertise in cyber insurance and statistics to help them navigate the challenges they face.

I am the founding Director of MSMC Laboratory at Illinois State University, where I lead a team of researchers who are dedicated to solving real-world problems in cybersecurity by developing innovative mathematical models and statistical methodologies. My research interests are in the areas of cybersecurity insurance, statistical modeling, and cyber risk analysis. I am passionate about advancing our understanding of these critical issues and working to ensure that companies have the tools they need to mitigate risk and protect against cyber threats.

I believe that by bringing together our expertise in statistics, insurance, and cybersecurity, we can make a positive impact on the world and create a safer, more secure future. I am honored to be a part of this important work and look forward to continuing to contribute to the field in the years to come.
