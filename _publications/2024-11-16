Modeling cyber data breach risks poses a formidable challenge, primarily
due to the intricate multivariate dependencies within a backdrop of limited
data. This study proposes a novel ensemble learning approach that effectively
captures both the temporal and cross-sectional dependence inherent in cyber
risks. The proposed approach is significantly different from those traditional
ones that directly model the multivariate dependence among risks. Instead,
our approach leverages bivariate copulas to generate predictive members to
capture the multivariate dependence, and the resulting predictive distribution
is calibrated by minimizing the distribution score. Furthermore, the proposed
model is applied in insurance pricing, and the results show that it can lead
to more profitable contracts. Through extensive simulations and analysis of
real-world data, our findings reveal that the proposed model has satisfactory
fitting and predictive performance and outperforms those in the literature.
