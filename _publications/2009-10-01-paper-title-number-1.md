Data breaches in healthcare have become a substantial concern in recent
years and cause millions of dollars in financial losses each year. It is fundamental for government regulators, insurance companies, and stakeholders to
understand the breach frequency and the number of affected individuals in
each state, as these are directly related to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and state data breach laws. However,
an obstacle to studying data breaches in healthcare is the lack of suitable
statistical approaches. We develop a novel multivariate frequency-severity
framework to analyze breach frequency and the number of affected individuals in this work.
