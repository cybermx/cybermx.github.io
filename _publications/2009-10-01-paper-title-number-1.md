Data breaches in healthcare have become a substantial concern in recent
years and cause millions of dollars in financial losses each year. It is fundamental for government regulators, insurance companies, and stakeholders to
understand the breach frequency and the number of affected individuals in
each state, as these are directly related to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and state data breach laws. However,
an obstacle to studying data breaches in healthcare is the lack of suitable
statistical approaches. We develop a novel multivariate frequency-severity
framework to analyze breach frequency and the number of affected individuals at the state level. A mixed effects model is developed to model the square
root transformed frequency, and the log-gamma distribution is proposed to
capture the skewness and heavy tail exhibited by the distribution of numbers
of affected individuals. We further discover a positive nonlinear dependence
between the transformed frequency and the log-transformed numbers of affected individuals (i.e., severity). In particular, we propose to use a D-vine
copula to capture the multivariate dependence among conditional severities,
given frequencies due to its inherent temporal structure and rich bivariate copula families. The rejection sampling technique is developed to simulate the
predictive distributions. Both the in-sample and out-of-sample studies show
that the proposed multivariate frequency-severity model that accommodates
nonlinear dependence has satisfactory fitting and prediction performances.
